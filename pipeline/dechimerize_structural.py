dechimerize_structural.py -- PRINCIPLED de-chimerization (no tuned edge-count, no truth-peeking).

A chimeric block = a Hi-C block that fused a chromosome with its own homoeolog (the A copy + the
C copy stuck together). Detect it STRUCTURALLY instead of by a hand-tuned count of intra-block edges:

  For each block:
    1. split its Hi-C sub-graph (Louvain) into communities;
    2. keep the LARGE halves (>= MIN_SUB = 1 Mb -- a biological size floor, not tuned on truth);
    3. the block is CHIMERIC iff two large halves are linked to EACH OTHER by a STRONG homoeolog
       edge (>= PAIR_MIN = 100k -- the SAME strong-edge floor already used for block pairing).
       That edge means half-1 is the A copy and half-2 is its C homoeolog -> a real A+C fusion.
    4. split into those halves; attach small leftovers to their most Hi-C-connected half; ITERATE.

Why paralogs/haplotigs do NOT trip it:
  * a within-chromosome duplication stays inside ONE Hi-C community -> never "two large halves";
  * the two ARMS of a pure chromosome are the SAME subgenome -> no homoeolog edge BETWEEN them.
So the only thing producing "two large Hi-C halves + a strong homoeolog seam" is a genuine fusion.
The two thresholds (1 Mb size, 100k strong edge) are pre-existing and biology/pairing-justified --
NOT tuned on the answer. Truth is used ONLY to score the final result, never to choose a cutoff.
